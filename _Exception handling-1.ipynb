    "    An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, which disrupts the normal flow of the program. It is a way to handle and manage unexpected or exceptional situations that may arise during the program's execution. Exceptions can be errors or other exceptional conditions that require special handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Syntax Errors:\n",
    "   Syntax errors occur when the code violates the rules of the Python syntax. They are typically detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase, before the program execution begins. Syntax errors prevent the code from being executed and need to be fixed before running the program. Examples of syntax errors include missing colons, mismatched parentheses, or incorrect indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example of a syntax error:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if x = 5:\n",
    "       print(\"x is 5\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Output:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Exceptions:\n",
    "   Exceptions, on the other hand, occur during the execution of a program when an error or exceptional condition arises that cannot be handled automatically. Exceptions can be caused by various factors, such as invalid user input, division by zero, file not found, network issues, or logical errors in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Exceptions are raised at runtime when an error or exceptional situation occurs, causing the program's normal flow to be interrupted. They can be caught and handled using try-except blocks, allowing the program to gracefully handle errors and continue executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example of handling an exception:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       x = 10 / 0\n",
    "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "       print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Output:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Cannot divide by zero.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, syntax errors occur during the parsing phase due to violations of the Python syntax rules and prevent the code from running. Exceptions occur at runtime due to errors or exceptional conditions and can be caught and handled using try-except blocks to handle unexpected situations during program execution."

    "Ans2: When an exception is not handled in Python, it leads to an error called an \"unhandled exception.\" When an unhandled exception occurs, the program's execution is halted, and an error message is displayed to the user, indicating the type of exception that occurred and the corresponding traceback information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate what happens when an exception is not handled:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    result = a / b\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the function with invalid arguments\n",
    "result = divide_numbers(10, 0)\n",
    "print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `divide_numbers` function is called with arguments 10 and 0. This will cause a `ZeroDivisionError` because dividing by zero is not allowed in mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the program encounters the exception, it halts the execution and displays an error message:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 2, in divide_numbers\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The error message indicates that a `ZeroDivisionError` occurred at line 2 in the `divide_numbers` function. It also shows the traceback, which provides information about the sequence of function calls that led to the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the exception is not handled by a try-except block or any other means, the program terminates abruptly, and the remaining code is not executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle exceptions and prevent unhandled exceptions, you can use try-except blocks to catch specific exceptions and provide alternative actions or error handling routines. By handling exceptions, you can gracefully recover from errors, display appropriate error messages, log the exceptions, or take other necessary actions to handle exceptional situations and allow the program to continue executing."

    "Ans3:In Python, the `try-except` statements are used to handle exceptions and provide a mechanism to gracefully handle errors and exceptional situations.

    "Ans4 :In Python, the `try-except-else-finally` statements provide a comprehensive way to handle exceptions and control the flow of execution in different scenarios. The `else` and `finally` blocks can be used along with the `try-except` block to further enhance exception handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of each block and an example to illustrate their usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `try` block:\n",
    "   The `try` block is used to enclose the code that may potentially raise an exception. It is the primary block where the code execution takes place. If an exception occurs within the `try` block, it is caught and processed by the corresponding `except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `except` block:\n",
    "   The `except` block specifies the code to be executed when a specific exception occurs. It catches and handles the exception raised within the `try` block. Multiple `except` blocks can be used to handle different types of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `else` block:\n",
    "   The `else` block is optional and follows the `try` and `except` blocks. It is executed only if no exception occurs within the `try` block. It is typically used to specify code that should run when the `try` block completes successfully without any exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `finally` block:\n",
    "   The `finally` block is optional and follows the `try` and `except` blocks. It is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is commonly used to specify cleanup code or actions that must be performed, such as closing files or releasing resources, irrespective of any exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = a / b\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "        print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Division Result:\", result)\n",
    "    finally:\n",
    "        print(\"Cleanup code or final actions.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the function with different arguments\n",
    "divide_numbers(10, 2)\n",
    "divide_numbers(10, 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `divide_numbers` function performs division between two numbers. Inside the `try` block, the division operation is performed, and the result is stored in the `result` variable. If a `ZeroDivisionError` occurs, the `except` block is executed, printing the error message. If no exception occurs, the `else` block is executed, printing the division result. Finally, the `finally` block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n",

However, when called with the arguments `10` and `0`, a `ZeroDivisionError` occurs, and the error message is printed. In both cases, the cleanup code or final actions specified in the `finally` block are executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the `try-except-else-finally` statements, you can handle exceptions, perform actions based on whether an exception occurred or not, and ensure necessary cleanup tasks are performed."
